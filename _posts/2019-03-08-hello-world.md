### Why this blog?
I'm Liz, a developer based in Gothenburg, Sweden.
As a programmer I learn new things everyday. Reading documentation, books, Stack Overflow and blogs is daily practise. The idea that documenting and sharing some of the things I learn might not only help myself keep track of my own development, but might even allow me to give some back to the community is pretty great to me. What's there to lose?

### Content
The language which I have most experience with is Java. For the past 6 months I have been getting into C# .NET, and it's awesome in so many ways! Coming from Java it's pure joy to write code using things like LINQ, properties and events. Right now I'm exploring ASP.NET MVC and WPF with Caliburn.Micro.
I'm also working on a few side-projects involving Javascript and Java.
