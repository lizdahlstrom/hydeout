 Hi there! My name is Liz. I code stuff, mostly in C#, Java or Javascript. As a person I am quite tenacious, which is something that goes well with my love for problem-solving. I adore the creative process of building things. Not only software and applications- In my free time I like to play the guitar and keyboard, and experiment with music making.
