<p class="message"> Hi there! My name is Liz. I code stuff, mostly in C#, Java or Javascript. As a person I am quite tenacious, which is something that goes well with my love for problem-solving. I adore the creative process of building and creating things. Not only software and applications. In my free time I like to play the guitar or keyboard, and make music.</p>
